How to run:
Prepare X, y, num_label=unique(y), lambda usually 0.01 0.1 1 10 100
Theta's usually randomly initialized, or zero's. Running randomly initialized
theta's often times do give lower cost function theta's.

* Run OneVsAll to get theta 
* Put theta in predictOneVsAll desired X and num_label=unique(y)
